This application helps a user to determine whether to take a bus or uber for their trip, based on weather and transit or uber availability. This uses the Bing Maps Routes API, Uber API, and OpenWeather. The user can log in and save trips for quick access. They can plan their trip and get weather and rates for a trip.

In order to get this application working you need to run "pip install requirements". This should install all that is needed.
